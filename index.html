        I am a 19 year old Australian. I completed my HSC in 2018 and after a small break, moved to Sydney with my partner to start our lives! Sadly I have not learnt any other languages beyond English, but as a close second, I have picked up a Canadian accent despite having 0 relation to even an American...

         I have a lot of interest when it comes to IT, some of my interests include mechanical keyboards, software, the utility of it all, entertainment, education, etc. But my main interest in IT comes from the design aspect of IT. Some examples of this are: the design of hardware (keyboards, monitors, consoles, headphones), software (hud, layout, colour palette, graphics), website design, process design, etc.

            <br>
            
        I started to become interested in IT when I was growing up with my family as they were all into IT, and all worked in the field (photography, tech repair, hardware purchasing for corporate companies, website programming), I always looked up to my uncles and wanted to do what they were doing. My experience in IT is mainly from personal use as I had access to computers at a young age which gave me time to explore and learn. I got into video games, photo editing, film making, script and terminal expirmenting and from there I took up a Multi-Media class and an Information Processing Technology class in High-School. I learned a lot and I enjoyed learning because IT is what I enjoy. Fast forward to now - I have been working full time for over half a year as a Helpdesk Analyst which is helping me learn new things everyday.

        <b>Why RMIT?</b> I chose RMIT solely looking at the Bachelor of IT, comparing it to the other universities they all seemed a bit dull. RMIT stood out as the layout of the website made all the information very clear. I have friends that are currently studying the same degree and they all recommend it. I also originally planned to go to study on the campus but after getting a job opportunity I decided to still follow my plan by studying here online, after looking at what universities supported online studies I was super happy to find out that RMIT was one of them.

        <b>What I expect to learn from my degree:</b> Coming out of my degree I expect to have learnt a lot of the essential and fundamental processes that relates to IT; Coding, creating websites, networking, data & information, security and privacy, ai, administration, etc. Whether what I learn is detailed or an overview of topics I expect that it will all build up together to give me a solid knowledge basis on IT as a whole with current trends and future trends. I am hoping to be very comfortable and eager to continue on in the IT industry after my studies.</p>

         <b>UI/UX Designer</b>
            
             <br>
                <br>
             
        The position of this job is a UI/UX Designer, the role involves designing the UI (user interface) which is physical layout and look of software, whilst also managing the UX (user experience) which is making sure that the intended users of the product/software will find it smooth, easy and efficient for their purpose. This should be done with consideration of the clients/team managers' needs for the software and the interface. This role stands out to me due to it being so design focused with a challenging edge to make it work in unison with user experience. It sounds right up my alley and I would also get the opportunity to work in a creative community/team.

            <li>I have great communication skills as I have studied communication skills and I perform them every day in my job.</li>
            <li>I work in a team on a day to day basis in an environment that would be similar to this role (advertising) and I have dealt with charts, storyboards, etc in this role.</li>
            <li>I have a creative eye and the ability to implement my visions into my work</li>

        How I would gain the necessary skills?
        <ul>
            <li>I would do a short course on design which could further lead to a degree to show that I am dedicated to the role and to learn extra skills.</li>
            <li>I would mainly focus on getting an idea of what software and products I would be working on so I donâ€™t go into the job blind eyed.</li>
            <li>Creating sketeches/storyboards and brainstorming of theoretical website layouts, apps, software, etc would help a lot. I could take this further by trying to create them.</li>
            <li>Work experience would also be a very good start, it would all depend on what time frame I am looking at.</li>
